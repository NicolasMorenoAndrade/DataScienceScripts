# Chaining operator -------------------------------------------------------

# select() the following columns from cran. Keep in mind
# that when you're using the chaining operator, you don't
# need to specify the name of the data tbl in your call to
# select().
#
# 1. ip_id
# 2. country
# 3. package
# 4. size
#
# The call to print() at the end of the chain is optional,
# but necessary if you want your results printed to the
# console. Note that since there are no additional arguments
# to print(), you can leave off the parentheses after
# the function name. This is a convenient feature of the %>%
# operator.

cran %>%
  select(ip_id,country,package,size) %>%
  print

# Use mutate() to add a column called size_mb that contains
# the size of each download in megabytes (i.e. size / 2^20).
#
# If you want your results printed to the console, add
# print to the end of your chain.

cran %>%
  select(ip_id, country, package, size) %>%
  mutate(size_mb=size/2^20)

# Use filter() to select all rows for which size_mb is
# less than or equal to (<=) 0.5.
#
# If you want your results printed to the console, add
# print to the end of your chain.

cran %>%
  select(ip_id, country, package, size) %>%
  mutate(size_mb = size / 2^20) %>%
  filter(size_mb<=0.5)

# arrange() the result by size_mb, in descending order.
#
# If you want your results printed to the console, add
# print to the end of your chain.

cran %>%
  select(ip_id, country, package, size) %>%
  mutate(size_mb = size / 2^20) %>%
  filter(size_mb <= 0.5) %>%
  arrange(desc(size_mb))


# Summarize function ------------------------------------------------------

# Compute four values, in the following order, from
# the grouped data:
#
# 1. count = n()
# 2. unique = n_distinct(ip_id)
# 3. countries = n_distinct(country)
# 4. avg_bytes = mean(size)
#
# A few thing to be careful of:
#
# 1. Separate arguments by commas
# 2. Make sure you have a closing parenthesis
# 3. Check your spelling!
# 4. Store the result in pack_sum (for 'package summary')
#
# You should also take a look at ?n and ?n_distinct, so
# that you really understand what is going on.
