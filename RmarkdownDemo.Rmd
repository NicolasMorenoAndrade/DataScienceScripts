## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r computetime, echo=FALSE}
time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
rand <- rnorm(1)
```

The current time is `r time`. My favorite random number is `r rand`.
```{r simulate data, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(100); y <- x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
```

```{r scatterplot, fig.height=4}
par(mar= c(5,4,1,1), las =1)
plot(x,y, main = "My simulated Data")
```
